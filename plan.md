Idk just gonna jot down some ideas for what to do and how I should develop this to ensure that it doesn't get complicated and confusing like the orginal version

## Getting started

I think to get started it would be a good idea to create the html website, not styled or looking good but some basic functionality to test the endpoints when i develop them

So to start that I need to create a webservice with GIN probably so i can serve the files

- [x] Install GIN
- [x] Serve static files
- [x] Handle assets
- [ ] Develop basic html webpages
- [ ] Create endpoints

After creating the basic endpoints for uploading the files and then storing them I will work on creating the database as I will need to track the images/files, where they are and who uploaded them

- [ ] Create basic database
- [ ] Update endpoints to interact with database (Using GORM)
- [ ] Account creation

After creating all of that the user will need some control over their files, like how flikhost originally was built - full control!

- [ ] Add account page to view and manage all images the user has posted
- [ ] Dedicated API key generation
- [ ] idk tba

Yup this looks good to me so far, I will note any changes that I make during the development process below:
