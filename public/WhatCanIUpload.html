                    <p>You can upload images upto 50MB.</p>
                    <p>Supported file types include: png, jpg (and all variants), webp, gif and more. We do not accept .RAW images are they are too big ;P</p>
                    <p>Files are stored forever unless we deem it "inappropriate", which isn't much.</p>
                    <p>If you don't like this then sorry you can use other services such as <a target="_blank" href="https://ghostfiles.uk">ghostfiles</a> (They are a good file hosting service however they have stricter rules regarding images)</p>

                <h1>Files</h1>
                <div class="termContainer">
                    <p>Unlike images, files can be up to 80MB in size.</p>
                    <p>Literally every single file type is supported for the file upload.</p>
                    <p>Files are stored forever however if you lack an account and the file is 51MB+ deletion for such file will be considered after 3 months. you can contact <a href="mailto:help@flik.host">us here</a> for exemptions.</p>
                    <p>Uhh yea I hope you find this acceptable :)</p>
