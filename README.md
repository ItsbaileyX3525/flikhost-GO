# Let's GO flik.host

Welcome to flik.host! I have decided to rewrite flikhost so that I can improve the systems and make flikhost even better than it was!

The main interesting thing about this rewrite is that I have decided to write it in GOLANG instead of that stinky PHP!

## Core features

Flik.host is and always will be file hosting service that is free that doesn't require an account or anything to get started, just drag and drop and store your image (or file) with us, it will be stored forever! (Unless you delete it.)

### Account creation

Creating an account is one of the best things you can do in flikhost, it lets you upload as many files as you want without worrying about them being deleted and you can just skip over the turnstile verification! This means you don't have to wait for it to verify you each time, talk about time saved!

This also means that you can create a bot to just spam uploads if you wish because well flik.host is free for everyone so do what you want with my storage!

### Storage

Flik.host doesn't use state of the art storage, nor does it have a lot tbh. Right now we are stuck at around 350GB so please be kind to my storage, other than that I use harddrives which are decently fast. 

### Image/File deletion

Image and files will get deleted after 3 months of them being alive on flik.host HOWEVER, as mentioned in the account creation sectiom, creating an account will exempt you from this rapture event.

### And yea...

There are some other cool things about flikhost that I cannot be assed explaining but for an 18+ cool time, open the "hentai" page >:)

## Theme

For a limted time, to follow this weeks theme, flikhost will accept images that are only winter themed. This means that any other image that doesn't have a winter feel to it will be rejected!
